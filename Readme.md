_A modified version (fork) of Notepad2 based on Kai Liu's and other people's patches._

## Changes compared to the official Notepad2:

* Code folding
* Support for bookmarks
* Option to mark all occurrences of a word
* Word auto-completion
* Syntax highlighting support for AutoHotkey, AutoIt3, AviSynth, Bash, CMake, Inno Setup,
  LaTeX, Lua, Markdown, NSIS, Ruby, Tcl and YAML scripts
* Improved support for NFO ANSI art
* Support for replacing Windows Notepad using a clean, unintrusive registry-based method
* Other various minor changes and tweaks

## Supported Operating Systems:
* Windows 2000 (when compiled with WDK, which is the default build)
* XP (SP3, SP2 might or might not work), Vista, 7 and 8 both 32-bit and 64-bit

## Notes:
* If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for the implemented lexers (and **not** only)
  feel free to **provide patches/pull requests**. Without patches or pull requests chances are
  that nothing will be fixed/implemented.
* I'm not interested in any **localization** of Notepad2.
