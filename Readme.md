_A modified version (fork) of Notepad2 based on Kai Liu's and other people's patches._

# Changes compared to the official Notepad2:

* Code folding
* Support for bookmarks
* Option to mark all occurrences of a word
* Word auto-completion
* Syntax highlighting support for AutoHotkey, AutoIt3, AviSynth, Bash, CMake, Inno Setup, LaTeX, Lua, Markdown, NSIS, Ruby, and Tcl scripts
* Improved support for NFO ANSI art
* Support for replacing Windows Notepad using a clean, unintrusive registry-based method
* Other various minor changes and tweaks

# Supported Operating Systems:
* Windows 2000 (when compiled with WDK, which is the default build)

# Notes:
* If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for the implemented lexers (and **not** only) feel free to **provide patches/pull requests**. Without patches or PR chances are that nothing will be fixed/implemented.
* I'm not interested in any **localization** of Notepad2.
